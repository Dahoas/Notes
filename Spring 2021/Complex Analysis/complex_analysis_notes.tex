\title{Complex Analysis}

\section{An Introduction}

\begin{idea}
	Proving non-analyticity. Show different limit in two diff. directions. Often useful to consider $h \in \R$ and $h \in i \R$. 
\end{idea}

\begin{prop}
	Often convenient to regard holomorphic definition as
	\begin{align*}
		f(z_0 + h) = f(z_0) + ah + o(h)
	\end{align*}

	for some $a$. Ie. the function is locally complex linear.
\end{prop}

\begin{remark}
	The above propsition is useful for proving chain rule.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Cauchy Riemann Equations}

\textbf{TAG:} ComplexAnalysis

\begin{remark}
	Cauchy riemann equations derived via simply differentiating f as a function of two varibles in real and comlex directions.
\end{remark}

\begin{quest}
	Cauchy riemann conditions are necessary. Are they sufficient?
\end{quest}

\begin{ans}
	Yes. 
	\begin{theorem}
		Let $f : \Omega \to \C$ with $f = u + iv$ and satisfying cauchy riemann. Then f is holomorphic.
	\end{theorem}
	\begin{proof}
		Fix $z_0 = x_0 + i y_0$.
		\begin{align*}
			u(x_0+h_1,y_0+h_2) = u(x_0,y_0) + u_xh_1 + u_y h_2 + o(h)
		\end{align*}

		and similarly for v. Then write $f(z_0 + h) - f(z_0)$ in terms of above and massage using cauchy riemann to get form $ah + o(h)$. 
	\end{proof}
\end{ans}

\begin{remark}
	Determinant of jacobian is really magnitude of norm of complex derivative squared.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
	$f(x,y) = \sqrt{|x||y|}$ satisfies cauchy riemann but is  not holomorphic. 
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}
	Radius of convergence R of power series is
	\begin{align*}
		R = \frac{1}{limsup |a_n|^{1/n}}
	\end{align*}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Idea is to compare to geometric series. Set R as desired. Then just compute(since we used limsup) and see that geometric series converges and or diverges in desired cases. This is also why we have problems on boundary. 
\end{proof}

\subsection{Power Series}

\textbf{TAG:} ComplexAnalysis

\begin{theorem}
	If f power series than $f'$ exists as $\sum n a_n z^{n-1}$ with same R, since $n^{1/n} \to 1$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Fix $|z_0| < r < R$. Set $g(z) = \sum na_nz^{n-1}$. Write
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{f(z_0+h)-f(z_0)}{h} - g(z) = \frac{S_N(z_0+h)-S_N(z_0)}{h} - S_N'(z_0) + S_N'(z_0)-g(z_0) + \frac{E_N(z_0+h) - E_N(z_0)}{h}
	\end{align*}

	The first term is small using triangle inequality and $(z_0 + h)^n - z_0^h = h((z_0+h)^{n-1}+(z_0+h)^{n-2}z_0 + ...)$ which is bounded in norm by something still in R once h gets small enough. Thus this third term converges.

	The second term is small since this is a convergent power series.

	The first term is small by definition. And we are done.

	Notice this proof simultaneously asserts existence and shows what it is.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}
	I had another proof by writing $f'(z_0 + h) = f(z_0) + ah + o(h)$ where $a = f'(z_0)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
	Power series are infinitely differentiable, since we have same disk of convergence. 
\end{remark}

\begin{quest}
	Is this how we establish holomorphic functions are infinitely differentiable? Cause they're all power series? How is this done?
\end{quest}

\begin{ans}
	Write holomorphic function as its taylor expansion and show they are close?
\end{ans}

\begin{theme}
	Anytime we prove something using algebraic facts, we have a complex argument since we haven't used the changed, rigid geometry at all.
\end{theme}

\begin{quest}
	What function is differentiable only once? Recall weierstrass cts everytwhere diff. nowhere
\end{quest}

\textbf{TAG:} ComplexIntegration

\begin{quest}
	Can we allow for a countable number of cuts? Will cutting in diff. ways countably lead to diff. integrals? Does this mess up notion of equivalency? What breaks? 
\end{quest}

\end{document}
