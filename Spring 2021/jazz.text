1. need to add voice leading to comp by using inversions and using common tones

2. Don't add too much rhythm that takes away from the melody. Down beat is destination. Okay to have updbeat in middle of measure. Accent down beat not upbeat. Make sure bass is low

3. voice comp by figuring out what's missing.
